# 🚂🤖 LittleJS AI

*An AI-assisted toolkit for making HTML5 games with [LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS) — starter templates, helper modules, docs, and prompts for AI workflows. The games built with it live in the [LittleJS Arcade](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJSArcade/).*

[LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS) is a fast, lightweight, and fully open source HTML5 game engine designed for simplicity and performance.

This repo is the **AI-assisted LittleJS toolkit** — everything you need to build games, but not the games themselves:
- starter templates you can fork and remix
- helper modules for menus, sound/FX, sprites, and live tweaking
- docs and prompts to improve LittleJS + AI workflows

The 50+ finished games built with these tools live in their own repo: the **[LittleJS Arcade](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJSArcade/)** ([source](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJSArcade)).

## 🤖 Claude Code Plugin

Use LittleJS AI directly inside [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — **no clone required**. Install once:

```
/plugin marketplace add KilledByAPixel/LittleJS-AI
/plugin install littlejs@littlejs-ai
```

Then in any empty folder, ask for a game ("make me a breakout game"). Claude scaffolds a complete project — engine included — that opens straight from `file://` with no server and no npm install.

The plugin ships four skills:

- `littlejs-conventions` — engine rules and pitfalls, applied automatically to any LittleJS code
- `new-littlejs-game` — scaffolds a complete playable game project
- `littlejs-api` — exact API signature lookup from the bundled reference
- `atlas-shape-art` — fast recolorable shape sprites from the built-in atlas

Cloning this repo is only needed for browsing the templates by hand or for the GPT workflow above — the plugin bundles everything else.

**Developing the plugin itself?** Load it from your working tree with `claude --plugin-dir .` (then `/reload-plugins` after edits). Don't `/plugin install` your local copy — that installs a frozen snapshot. When bumping the engine in `dist/`, also refresh `reference.md` by hand and bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, or installed users never receive the update.

For other tools, LittleJS also works great with GitHub Copilot, Codex, and Cursor.

LittleJS and everything in this repository is **MIT licensed!** See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## 🛠️ Make Your Own

Clone the repo and you have everything you need to build games — from quick prototypes to large, multi-file projects. No external assets and no dependencies to play; the only npm packages are optional build tools.

### Start a new game

1. Copy the starter folder [examples/emptyGame/](examples/emptyGame/) to `examples/<yourGame>/`.
2. Edit `game.js` — and add more files (`player.js`, `ui.js`, `constants.js`, …) as the game grows.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser. That's it — it runs straight from `file://`, no server needed.

Games use the **global LittleJS API**: load `dist/littlejs.js` with a plain `<script>` tag and call globals like `engineInit`, `drawText`, and `vec2` directly. Keep gameplay modular across several `.js` files for medium and large games.

### Ship a single-file build (optional)

A single root `build.mjs` concatenates the engine + your source, minifies it, and produces one self-contained `index.html` plus a `.zip` (great for game jams).

```sh
npm install               # once, in the repo root — installs terser + bestzip
node build.mjs yourGame   # builds examples/yourGame/build/ and yourGame.zip
node build.mjs --all      # builds every game that has a build.json
```

### 📝 Feature templates

Single-file references to copy patterns from when adding a feature — not full game scaffolds:

- [game.html](templates/game.html) — minimal scaffold (shapes, text, camera)
- [boardGame.html](templates/boardGame.html) — grid-based games (chess, sokoban, match-3)
- [menuGame.html](templates/menuGame.html) — title, pause, options, medals, HUD toolbar
- [box2dGame.html](templates/box2dGame.html) — Box2D physics (pool, plinko, pinball)
- [textureGame.html](templates/textureGame.html) — procedural sprite atlases from canvas draw ops
- [tweakableGame.html](templates/tweakableGame.html) — live-tweak globals via an HTML slider overlay
- [uiGame.html](templates/uiGame.html) — canvas-drawn UI (menus, sliders, dialogs)
- [threejsGame.html](templates/threejsGame.html) — three.js 3D scene behind the LittleJS canvas

Mix in helper scripts to add features: `menus.js` (DOM menus + best score + game-over dialog + setPlaying/quitToTitle), `gameFx.js` (procedural SFX + screen shake), `textureGenerator.js` (sprite painter), `tweakables.js` (live value tweaking).

### 🧊 Three.js 3D games

The engine includes a [three.js](https://threejs.org/) plugin (`ThreeJSPlugin` + `ThreeJSObject`) that renders a 3D scene behind the LittleJS canvas — LittleJS keeps handling the input, physics, and HUD while three.js draws the world. See [examples/threejsGame/](examples/threejsGame/) for a mini 3D platformer demo (three.js loads from a CDN at startup, everything else works the same as any other game).
