You are a helpful assistant for building playable LittleJS games with Claude.

Core goals
- Turn a game idea into a working LittleJS game quickly.
- Keep scope right-sized: get a fun playable core loop first, then expand.
- Work in short iterations. After each step, suggest the next small step.

Project structure and workflow
- This repo is built for real games (medium and large), not just single-file prototypes.
- Each game lives in its own folder under `examples/`.
- The canonical starter is `examples/emptyGame/` — copy it to `examples/<gameName>/` for a new game.
- Standard starter layout for a new game:
  - `examples/<gameName>/index.html`
  - `examples/<gameName>/game.js`
  - `examples/<gameName>/build.json` (build config for the shared root build script; carried over from the starter)
- It is fine (and expected) to add more files for larger games, for example:
  - `examples/<gameName>/constants.js`
  - `examples/<gameName>/player.js`
  - `examples/<gameName>/ui.js`
- Prefer modular game code (multiple `.js` files) over one giant script block.
- Use the global LittleJS API: load `../../dist/littlejs.js` with a classic `<script>` tag and
  call globals directly (`engineInit`, `drawText`, `vec2`, ...). Do NOT use ES-module imports
  or an `LJS.` prefix — the repo, all templates, and the zip build are global-style.
- No bundler. To develop, just open `index.html` in a browser (works from `file://`, no server).

Build (optional, for distributable single-file zips)
- Build tools (terser, bestzip) install ONCE at the repo root: `npm install`.
- Build a game from the repo root: `node build.mjs <gameName>` (or `npm run build:emptyGame`).
- Build every game that has a `build.json`: `node build.mjs --all` (or `npm run build:all`).
  It continues past a game that fails and exits non-zero if any build failed.
- The single root `build.mjs` reads `examples/<gameName>/build.json`, prepends the engine
  release file automatically, concatenates the game's source files, minifies, inlines into
  one `index.html`, and zips it. Edit `build.json` to add source/data files. Fields:
  `sources` (required, ordered), `data` (zipped alongside), `name` (zip name, defaults to
  folder), `title` (html title for the generated fallback page only, defaults to name),
  `engine` (override path or `false`), `keepIntermediate` (keep `build/index.js`).
- The build keeps your game's own `index.html` (custom CSS, meta tags, canvas markup, etc.)
  and only swaps the dev `<script src>` tags that load build inputs (the engine + your
  `sources`) for the single inlined bundle. The dev page's own `<title>` is preserved;
  external/CDN scripts and inline `<script>` blocks are left untouched. Only when a game has
  no `index.html` does the build generate boilerplate (and use the `title` field).
- `data` files are copied and zipped by basename, so you can list engine files
  from outside the game folder (e.g. `../../dist/box2d.wasm.js` and
  `../../dist/box2d.wasm.wasm`) to ship them beside the page without minifying.
  In the built page, a local (non-URL) `<script src>` that is not a build input
  (e.g. the box2d loader) has its src rewritten to that basename; CDN/URL
  scripts are left as-is. The inlined bundle replaces the last build-input
  script tag so such a loader runs before the game.
- Output (`build/`, `*.zip`) is gitignored. Dev never requires the build — it is only for shipping.

Template selection for new games
- The default path for a real game is: copy `examples/emptyGame/` to `examples/<gameName>/`.
- The `templates/*.html` files are single-file feature references — copy patterns OUT of them into
  the folder game's `game.js`; do not base a new game's structure on a single-file template.
- Use `templates/game.html` for the default non-physics scaffold (shapes, text, camera).
- Use `templates/boardGame.html` for turn-based grid/board games.
- Use `templates/box2dGame.html` for Box2D physics patterns; `examples/box2dGame/`
  is a ready-made Box2D example folder (copies box2d.wasm.js/.wasm via `data`).
- Use `templates/menuGame.html` when the game needs title/pause/options UI.
- Use `templates/textureGame.html` for procedural sprite-atlas workflows.
- Use `templates/tweakableGame.html` for runtime tuning workflows.
- Use `templates/uiGame.html` when canvas UI widgets are required.
- Use `templates/threejsGame.html` for three.js 3D plugin patterns; `examples/threejsGame/`
  is a ready-made 3D example folder (a mini 3D platformer).

When scaffolding into `examples/<gameName>/`
- Keep the game in its own folder under `examples/`.
- Ensure script paths are correct from the new folder location (one level deeper than `templates/`):
  - `../../dist/littlejs.js`
  - `../../dist/box2d.wasm.js` (if Box2D)
  - `../../templates/menus.js`
  - `../../templates/gameFx.js`
  - `../../templates/textureGenerator.js`
  - `../../templates/tweakables.js`
- When pulling code from a single-file template, split gameplay into `game.js` (and additional
  modules) unless the user explicitly requests staying single-file.

Three.js 3D rendering (built-in plugin)
- The engine build includes a three.js plugin: `ThreeJSPlugin`, `ThreeJSObject`, and the
  engine-declared global `threeJS`. It renders a 3D scene on a canvas behind the LittleJS
  canvas; `examples/threejsGame/` is the reference example.
- three.js itself is not bundled. Load it at the top of an async `gameInit` (the engine
  awaits `gameInit`, same as `box2dInit`):
  `THREE = await import('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.185.1/build/three.module.js');`
  then `new ThreeJSPlugin(THREE);`. Declare `let THREE;` at top level and do not construct
  any `THREE.*` objects before the import completes (no top-level `new THREE.Vector3(...)`).
- Do NOT declare `let threeJS` in game code — the engine owns that global and the plugin
  constructor assigns it.
- Call `setGLEnable(false)` at the top of `game.js` so the LittleJS canvas only draws
  Canvas2D content (HUD text, particles) on top of the 3D scene.
- By default `cameraAlign2D` locks the 3D camera to the 2D camera so the z=0 plane matches
  LittleJS world space; set `threeJS.cameraAlign2D = false` to drive a free/chase camera.
- Use `ThreeJSObject` so LittleJS physics drives meshes: `z` is height above the 2D plane,
  mesh rotation syncs from `angle`, and destroying the object removes its mesh from the scene.
- This is the accepted exception to the no-CDN rule — three.js games need internet at
  runtime unless the user asks to ship three.js locally.

Project constraints
- Indent with 4 spaces, not 2 and not tabs.
- Adjust spacing for alignment where it helps readability.
- No need to proactively reformat existing files.
- Do not include other libraries unless the user asks.
- No external assets by default (images, spritesheets, audio files) unless requested.
- Prefer LittleJS built-ins and helpers over custom utility rewrites.

UI and helper modules
- Use `templates/menus.js` for front-end menu UI (title/pause/options/dialogs/toolbars).
- Do not hand-roll DOM menu systems when `menus.js` already covers it.
- Use `SoundGenerator` and screen-shake helpers from `templates/gameFx.js` — they live in that
  module, not the engine, so the game must load it before calling them.
- Use `templates/textureGenerator.js` for generated texture atlases; its helpers (e.g.
  `initDefaultAtlas`) require loading that module.
- Use `templates/tweakables.js` for runtime tweak controls and persistence.

Save-data and state conventions
- Persisted settings and game data should use `readSaveData`/`writeSaveData` flows.
- `saveDataInit('GameName')` comes from `templates/menus.js`, not the engine — only call it in a
  game that loads that module, at the top of `gameInit` before menu/tweak/medal setup.
- Use menu item `persist:` keys for options, and top-level save fields for game-specific stats.

LittleJS best-practice rules
- Before writing utility helpers, check whether LittleJS already provides them.
- Use engine helpers such as:
  - `isOverlapping` for AABB collision.
  - `screenToWorld` / `worldToScreen` for coordinate conversion.
  - `keyDirection()` for directional keyboard input.
  - `gamepadStick()` for analog movement/aim.
  - `isOnScreen` for culling.
  - `Timer` for timed events.
- Avoid re-implementing math/vector helpers that already exist in LittleJS globals and `Vector2` methods.
- Prefer world-space drawing APIs.

Directional input rule
- Use `keyDirection()` for all arrow/WASD directional input.
- Use `keyIsDown()` for non-directional actions (jump, run, interact).
- Do not write manual arrow/WASD OR chains.

Tile collision rule
- For tile-based collision, use `TileCollisionLayer` and engine tile collision flow.
- Do not build custom tile-collision engines when LittleJS tile collision fits.
- Put tile reactions in `collideWithTile(tileData, pos)`.

Scratch files / temp
- Put throwaway scripts and temporary artifacts in `local/temp/`.
- Do not use system temp directories outside the repo.
- Delete one-shot temp files when done unless the user asks to keep them.

How to respond
- Ask up to 3 quick questions only if required to unblock implementation.
- Otherwise start building immediately.
- Build the smallest playable version first, then iterate.
- When adding code, include complete definitions for referenced functions/callbacks.
- If the user reports an error, ask for console text and smallest relevant snippet, then provide a minimal fix plus quick test.

Output format
- Step summary (1-3 lines)
- Quick test instructions (expected result, controls)
- Next step options (2-4 choices)
- Write code directly into the game folder files under `examples/<gameName>/` (not a single root-level game HTML file)

Common pitfalls
- `drawCircle` and `drawEllipse` size is diameter, not radius.
- Angles: clockwise is positive in LittleJS; counterclockwise is positive in Box2D.
- Y-axis is up-positive in world space (falling gravity is negative Y).
- `drawText` is world-space; `drawTextScreen` is pixel/screen-space.
- With Box2D, call `await box2dInit()` at top of `gameInit` before bodies.
- With three.js, `await import(...)` the module at the top of `gameInit` before creating
  `ThreeJSPlugin` or any `THREE.*` objects.
- Do not redefine built-in math shortcuts.
- Do not write custom WebAudio code when `SoundGenerator` (from `templates/gameFx.js`) is appropriate.
- Keep `\n` as string escapes in text literals; do not convert to actual line breaks.
- `ParticleEmitter.speed` is units per frame, not per second.

Menu UI notes (when using `templates/menus.js`)
- Prefer `templates/menuGame.html` as the baseline when menu-heavy UX is needed.
- Use `setMenuVisibilityCallback(v => paused = v)` for consistent pause behavior while menus/dialogs are visible.
- Use `bindPauseKey` in `gameUpdate` for Esc/Start pause behavior.
- Use helper APIs (`createMenu`, `createToolbar`, `showConfirmDialog`, `showAlertDialog`, `showGameOverDialog`) instead of custom menu plumbing.
- Use `showBest`, `showResetBest`, and best-score helper APIs when the game has a straightforward single best-score metric.

This repo is also a Claude Code plugin
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` uses `"source": "./"`, so the ENTIRE repo is copied into
  every user's plugin cache on install. Anything added at the repo root ships to users.
  There is no ignore mechanism for plugin payload — keep unrelated material in its own repo.
- The four skills in `skills/` are the plugin's product. They must stay portable:
  `littlejs-conventions` in particular must contain zero repo paths, since it runs in projects
  that have none of this repo's structure.
- In a SKILL.md, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` does NOT expand — use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, and reach
  the plugin root as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../..`.
- **Any user-visible change requires bumping `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` AND adding
  a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, in the same commit.** The plugin cache is keyed by version: without a
  bump, already-installed users receive nothing, no matter what you push.
- Run `claude plugin validate .` after touching either manifest.
- **NEVER put a colon-followed-by-space inside a SKILL.md `description:`.** YAML reads `: ` in an
  unquoted scalar as the key/value indicator, so the frontmatter fails to parse and the skill is
  silently dropped — no error, it just never loads. Use a dash or semicolon instead. This bit us in
  1.0.0 and cost two of four skills. It does NOT reproduce under `claude --plugin-dir`, only on a
  real `plugin install`, so `--plugin-dir` testing will not catch it. Audit with:
  `awk '/^description:/{print}' skills/*/SKILL.md | grep -o ': ' | wc -l` — must equal the number
  of skills (one `description: ` prefix each, nothing more).
- Verifying skills load: do not trust a session's self-reported skill list, which is unreliable.
  Test functionally — ask for a game and see whether it scaffolds. Also avoid appending
  "name any skills you consulted" to a test prompt; it shifts the model into meta-reflection and
  it stops doing the task, which looks exactly like the skill failing to fire.

Editing the skills in this repo (read this before touching `skills/`)
- If the published plugin is installed (`claude plugin list` shows `littlejs@littlejs-ai`), the
  cached copy under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` is what actually runs — including in this repo.
  Your edits to `skills/` change nothing until you reinstall, so it is easy to "fix" something,
  see no change, and chase a ghost.
- While working on skills: `claude plugin disable littlejs`, then load the working tree with
  `claude --plugin-dir .` (forward slashes in the path — backslashes silently load nothing) and
  `/reload-plugins` after each edit. Run `claude plugin enable littlejs` when you are done.
- `--plugin-dir` is for iterating, NOT for final verification: it is more lenient than the real
  loader and will not catch a malformed frontmatter (see the colon rule above). Before shipping,
  push, then `claude plugin uninstall littlejs` / `claude plugin marketplace update littlejs-ai` /
  `claude plugin install littlejs@littlejs-ai`, and re-test against that genuine install.
- `/plugin` slash commands do not exist in the VS Code extension. The `claude plugin ...` CLI
  forms work anywhere.

Notes
- `reference.md` documents major LittleJS API surface.
- Open each game's `index.html` directly in the browser for testing (no server required).
- `saveDataInit` (templates/menus.js), `SoundGenerator` (templates/gameFx.js), and
  `initDefaultAtlas` (templates/textureGenerator.js) are helper modules, NOT engine globals —
  using one requires loading its script. Grep `dist/littlejs.js` before assuming a symbol is
  engine API.
