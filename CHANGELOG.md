# Changelog

Notable changes to the **littlejs** Claude Code plugin. Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are [semantic](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Maintainers:** the `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is what gates updates — the plugin cache is keyed by it, so people who already installed the plugin receive **nothing** until that number changes. Any user-visible change means bumping it and adding an entry here in the same commit.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.6] - 2026-08-01

Ships engine **1.18.25**, which closes both gaps this plugin's feedback surfaced upstream.

### Fixed

- **The scaffolding skill stated a limitation that no longer exists.** It told agents `engineUpdate` is private to `engineInit`, so a frame could not be advanced headlessly and `Timer`-driven logic could not be verified. That was true through 1.18.24 and is now false — leaving it in would have stopped anyone using the capability that was added because of this exact complaint.

### Added

- **Deterministic headless stepping, in the engine.** `setEngineManualStep(true)` stops the engine driving itself with `requestAnimationFrame`, and `engineStep(frames)` then advances exactly that many fixed updates. Paired with `setHeadlessMode(true)`, time-driven behaviour — `Timer`, spawn intervals, cooldowns — becomes testable rather than something you verify by watching.

  Measured against the shipped build, not assumed: 100 consecutive `engineStep(1)` calls produced exactly 100 updates with zero drift, `engineStep(60)` exactly 60, `engineStep(0)` nothing, `frame` matched the update count exactly, and 10 steps while `paused` advanced nothing. The engine also does not self-drive in manual mode.

  Both the scaffolding skill's verification step and `littlejs-conventions` now point at it, and `reference.md` documents the full contract under "Headless testing".
- **`readSaveData` now asserts on a scalar default** in debug builds, catching the silent `NaN` that 1.0.5 could only warn about. The conventions skill still carries the guidance, since `ASSERT` is stripped from release builds — the assert catches the mistake, the skill prevents it.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-08-01

Changes from real-world feedback after building a game with 1.0.4.

### Fixed

- **Scaffolded games produced a `build.json` referencing a `tiles.png` that no longer exists**, so `npm run build` failed on first use. `tiles.png` was removed from `emptyGame` but four references survived — the starter's own `build.json` (which broke `node build.mjs emptyGame` outright) and three in the scaffolding skill. These games draw their art procedurally and ship no external textures, so the skill now says to omit `data` entirely unless the game genuinely ships a file alongside the page.
- **`readSaveData` with a scalar default silently produces `NaN`.** It returns `{...yourDefault, ...whatWasStored}`, so `readSaveData('best', 0)` spreads a number and yields `{}` rather than `0`. A best-score built on it becomes `NaN` with no error anywhere — while following the skill's own advice to prefer it over hand-rolled localStorage. Now called out in `littlejs-conventions` twice: in the save-data guidance and again in the pitfalls list, where it belongs alongside the other silent-failure entries.
- `package.json` still said `"version": "1.0.0"` while the plugin was on 1.0.4. Harmless to the plugin, but it is the obvious file to check, and one reader ended up grepping `engineVersion` out of the engine build to answer the question. Now tracks the plugin version and says which file actually gates updates.

### Added

- **A verification step before handing a game over.** Step 4 previously ended at "write the loop, then summarize", delegating all testing to the user — which is how the `readSaveData` bug above reached a finished game. There is now an explicit Step 5: check the script parses, re-read for values that silently go `NaN`, and report what was verified.
- **Guidance to serve over HTTP when verifying your own work.** The `file://` promise holds for a user opening the page, but an agent preview pane commonly renders `file://` as a static snapshot where the engine runs and `game.js` does not. The symptom is badly misleading — hoisted functions exist, classes and consts are `undefined`, the canvas is 0x0, and the engine throws `Constructed Vector2 is invalid`, which reads like a name collision. Step 5 names the signature so nobody debugs a phantom.
- A note that `new-littlejs-game` takes priority over general brainstorming workflows, so "make me a game" with another design-exploration plugin installed yields a game rather than a requirements interview.
- A world-scale anchor in `littlejs-conventions` (a typical view is roughly 35x20 units), matching why the existing `drawText ~3` / `drawTextScreen ~80` note is useful.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **`build.mjs` is now hidden from local diffs too, not just GitHub pull requests.** 1.0.3 gave it `linguist-vendored`, which is a GitHub-only hint — a human reviewing a PR saw it collapsed, but `git diff` still printed all 348 lines, and that is exactly what an AI agent reads. Adding `-diff` closes the gap: a fresh scaffold's first commit drops from ~690 lines to ~342, which is `game.js` plus a few lines of config.

  `templates/**` deliberately keeps `linguist-vendored` without `-diff`. Helper modules are plausible to tweak while making a game — sounds in `gameFx.js`, sprites in `textureGenerator.js` — and silently swallowing a real edit there would be worse than showing it. `build.mjs` is shared tooling nobody edits by hand, so hiding it outright is safe. If it ever isn't, deleting one line from `.gitattributes` restores normal diffing.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **A new game's first diff now shows only the game.** 1.0.2 hid the engine; this extends the same treatment to `build.mjs` and the copied `templates/` helper modules, which are also vendored from the plugin rather than written by you. A fresh scaffold went from ~1,800 reviewable lines to a few hundred — `game.js`, `index.html`, `build.json` — with everything copied in collapsed.

  The two markers are used deliberately, not interchangeably. The engine gets `-diff` as well, because it is generated, enormous, and never edited by hand. `build.mjs` and `templates/**` get `linguist-vendored` only: collapsed in pull requests, but if you later tweak a helper module, that edit still appears in a normal `git diff` instead of being silently swallowed.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **Scaffolded projects now mark the vendored engine as vendored.** New projects get a `.gitattributes` with `dist/** -diff linguist-vendored`. Without it the engine lands in the first commit as ~640KB of apparently-new code, and every later reviewer — human or AI — treats it as project source to read and verify. One real session spent its effort on *"let me verify the copy is byte-identical myself so the reviewer doesn't have to line-read 650KB of third-party code."* Now `git diff` reports `Binary files differ` and GitHub collapses it in pull requests. The skill also states outright that the engine must never be reviewed, diffed, or summarized.
- **Only one engine build is vendored.** Projects previously received both `littlejs.js` and `littlejs.release.js` (~640KB each) although nothing ever loaded the second. Now just `littlejs.js`, with `build.json` pointing at it — half the footprint, no functional loss. Copy `littlejs.release.js` in by hand if you want the smallest possible jam build.
- Plugin and marketplace descriptions rewritten to say what the plugin is for rather than enumerate engine trivia, and to mention Box2D physics and three.js 3D support.

### Added

- A `.gitattributes` in this repo, for the same reason: `dist/` is a vendored engine build and should not appear in review.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- **`littlejs-conventions` and `new-littlejs-game` silently failed to load when the plugin was installed.** Both descriptions contained a colon followed by a space (`...mistakes are silent: drawCircle...` and `...IS the answer: scaffold...`). In YAML a plain unquoted scalar treats `: ` as the key/value indicator, so the frontmatter failed to parse and the skill was dropped — with no error anywhere. Only the two shortest descriptions, which happened to contain no embedded colon, loaded.

  This is worth knowing about because it does not reproduce under `claude --plugin-dir`, so every pre-release test passed. It surfaced only on a real `plugin install`, and the symptom is indistinguishable from a badly-worded trigger: asking for a game just produced "which tech stack do you want?"

  **If you write a skill description, keep `: ` out of it.** Use a dash or a semicolon instead.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-01

First release. The repo itself is the plugin: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` points at the repo root, so `dist/`, `templates/`, `examples/`, `reference.md`, and `build.mjs` ship as payload and the engine travels with the plugin.

### Added

- **`littlejs-conventions` skill** — portable engine rules and pitfalls, applied to any LittleJS code in any project. Carries knowledge that previously lived only in this repo's `CLAUDE.md` and could not travel: sizes are diameters, `lerp` takes percent last, `ParticleEmitter` speed is per-frame, spin is `angleVelocity`, Y is up-positive, `update()` needs no `super.update()`, and top-level consts collide with engine globals.
- **`new-littlejs-game` skill** — scaffolds a complete playable project into any empty directory, copying the engine and chosen starter out of the installed plugin. Opens in a browser straight from disk; no clone, no `npm install`, no server.
- **`littlejs-api` skill** — grep-only lookup into the bundled 900-line `reference.md`, so exact signatures are available without loading 48KB into context.
- **`atlas-shape-art` skill** — renders shape-heavy games as tinted atlas tiles instead of per-shape draw calls.
- **Standalone build mode** — `node build.mjs` with no arguments now builds the current folder when it contains a `build.json`, which is what lets a scaffolded project produce a single-file zip.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and a marketplace entry with author, homepage, repository, license, and tags.

### Fixed

- `build.mjs` still pointed at the pre-rename `games/` folder, so **every build in the repo was broken**. Now targets `examples/`, and the stale `GAMES_DIR` constant is `EXAMPLES_DIR`.
- `build.mjs` did not quote interpolated paths passed to terser and bestzip, so builds failed in any directory containing a space — which, on Windows, is most home directories.
- `.gitignore` also still referenced `games/`, so roughly 1.3MB of generated build output under `examples/` had been committed. Untracked, files kept on disk.
- `CLAUDE.md` presented `saveDataInit`, `SoundGenerator`, and `initDefaultAtlas` as engine API. They are helper wrappers in `templates/menus.js`, `templates/gameFx.js`, and `templates/textureGenerator.js`; a scaffolded project that called them would throw on startup.
- `jsconfig.json` included `./games/**/*.js`, giving editor IntelliSense no coverage of any game.

### Removed

- The `iterate-sprite` skill and its local HTTP server — an experiment that did not work out.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, which described a repo layout from roughly six months earlier.
- The `GPT/` ChatGPT package, moved to its own repo at [KilledByAPixel/LittleJS-GPT](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS-GPT) with its history. A marketplace install copies the whole repo, so it was shipping 680KB of unrelated files to everyone installing a game-dev plugin.
